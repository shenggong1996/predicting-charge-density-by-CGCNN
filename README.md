For the work 'Predicting charge density distribution of materials using a local-environment-based graph convolutional network', we use the original version of CGCNN (https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn)
as the machine learning model. In order to learn charge density distribution of materials by CGCNN, we convert the CHG file from VASP into a CGCNN-style dataset directory, 
which can be done by the code shared here. More details about the scheme can be found in the aforementioned paper. If you want use the scheme, please cite:
